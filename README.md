# COMP 1004
 
Hello and welcome to my COMP1004 repository,

In this repository:

- My COMP1004 project: The Archives

A table top game companion app for multiple popular titles such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and even card games such as Magic: The Gathering. This site will assist in and even be able to directly play these games and will prove to be a fundamental tool for the future of table top games. This site will encourage collaboration through its inclusion of online features such as the sharing of Custom classes in DnD or decks of cards in Mtg. 


- My practice projects: RazorPagesMovie and SignalRChat

These are the results of my initial research and a demonstration of the fundamental basics of my project. I have included them here as they are referred to in my portfolio.
